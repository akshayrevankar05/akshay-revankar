Chevrolet Camaro SS 2010 – Surface Model in Autodesk Alias

This project involves the complete 3D surface modeling of the Chevrolet Camaro SS 2010 using Autodesk Alias, a professional tool for automotive design and Class-A surfacing. 
The goal was to recreate the iconic muscle car with high accuracy and surface quality with some personalized touch, focusing on its aggressive styling and bold character lines.

The process began with importing reference blueprints and aligning them across all key views. 2D and 3D curves were then created to form a wireframe, which served as the foundation for building 
the car’s surfaces. Using Alias’s surfacing tools, the model was gradually developed, starting with basic forms and progressing to detailed elements such as the hood vents, headlights, rear spoiler,
and body flares.

In the final stage, textures and shaders were applied to enhance the model’s realism, simulating real materials like metallic paint, glass, and rubber. The finished model accurately
represents the design language and performance attitude of the 2010 Camaro SS.

This project showcases strong skills in digital modeling, surface continuity, and attention to automotive design detail within Autodesk Alias.
